# English
Imagine two strings, A and B. 
B is generated by shuffling the letters in A and adding a new random letter to it at a random position. 

Write a function that takes A and B and returns the new letter.

### Examples
```clj
(diff "" "j") ;=> \j
(diff "a" "ab") ;=> \b
(diff "abc" "xcab") ;=> \x
(diff "xxyyzz" "xzyfyxz") ;=> \f
(diff "cccvv" "cvvcvc") ;=> \v
```
