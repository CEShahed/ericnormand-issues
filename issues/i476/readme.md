# issue 476 - How many digits? :: [link](https://ericnormand.me/issues/476)

## Description

Imagine you took all the integers between `n` and `m` (exclusive, `n < m`) and concatenated them together. *How many digits* would you have? 

Write a function that takes two numbers and returns how many digits. 
Note that the numbers can get very big, so it is not possible to build the string in the general case.

### Examples
```clj
(num-digits 0 1) ;=> 0 (there are no integers between 0 and 1)
(num-digits 0 10) ;=> 9 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
(num-digits 9 100) ;=> 179
```
