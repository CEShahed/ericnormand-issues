Another contrived math problem. This one I think is actually pretty hard. 
It's got detecting primes, string manipulation, and combinations.

Your task is to write a function that takes an integer and finds all primes that are substrings of the decimal digits of that integer.

### Examples
```clj
(find-primes 2) ;=> [2]
(find-primes 22) ;=> [2 2]
(find-primes 717) ;=> [7 7 17 71]
(find-primes 1) ;=> []
(find-primes 44) ;=> []
```

### Notes:
- Return the primes in ascending order.
- If a prime appears more than once, it should be in the returned sequence that many times.
